# Farm Fresh Produce

## PITCH

### What do we want!?!? Fresh, organic, non-GMO, pesticide/herbicide free produce grown by local farmers. How do we get it? By using our wonderful app that links up farmers ###with those excited to consume delicious fresh locally sourced produce. Farmers throw away tons of food and lose money on their surplus inventory. Lets fix that problem.

## MVP

- As a Farmer I can log in and add available options for purchase from my farm.
- As a consumer I can log in and see produce available in my local area (No GEOlocation necessary for MVP).
- As a farmer I can Edit and delete items from my inventory.
- As a consumer I can fill up my shopping cart, and place an order (no payment necessary for MVP).
- As a farmer I can see the orders that come in for my produce so that I can prepare the orders for pick up.

## STRETCH

- Add a google maps component that allows users to geolocate the farms in their local area.
- Provide a payment plan or subscription service that allows me monthly/weekly access to farm fresh produce
- Link farmers up with local drivers so that the app can become the instacart of farm fresh produce
